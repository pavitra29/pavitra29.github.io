    Front-end technologies used in this single page app are:
    <ul>
        <li data-ng-repeat="x in tech">
            {{x}}
        </li>
    </ul>
    I have made use of AngularJS to create this single page app.
    I have used Bootstrap for providing the menu layout with 
	navigation bar. In order to navigate between pages, I have 
	implemented routing and linked the pages using #. AngularJS 
	routing is a very useful feature as it loads the different
    pages without page refresh. I used AngularJS and Bootstrap 
	because it takes less effort to develop beautiful applications 
	than using other technologies. Also it is more efficient and
	help you to write neat and clear programs!

	I am excited to be a front-end developer because the work 
	is more visual and I can use my creativity to build good 
	looking applications. This eagerness drove me towards self-
	learning AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and PHP.
