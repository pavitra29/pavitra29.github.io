    Front-end technologies used in this single page app are:
    <ul>
        <li data-ng-repeat="x in tech">
            {{x}}
        </li>
    </ul>
    I have used AngularJS to create this app as it is easy to implement. I have used Bootstrap for providing the menu layout. In order to navigate between pages, I have implemented routing and linked the pages together. AngularJS routing is a very useful feature as it loads the pages without page refresh. Also it is more efficient and helps you to write neat and clear programs which are responsive!

	I am excited to be a front-end developer because the work is more visual and I can use my creativity to build beautiful applications. My eagerness drove me towards self-learning AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and this Single Page App is a demonstration of what I learnt.
