    Front-end technologies used in this single page app are:
    <ul>
        <li data-ng-repeat="x in tech">
            {{x}}
        </li>
    </ul>
    I have made use of AngularJS to create this app as it takes less effort to develop beautiful applications than using other technologies. I have used Bootstrap for providing the menu layout with navigation bar. In order to navigate between pages, I have implemented routing and linked the pages using #. AngularJS routing is a very useful feature as it loads the different pages without page refresh. Also it is more efficient and helps you to write neat and clear programs!

	I am excited to be a front-end developer because the work is more visual and I can use my creativity to build good looking applications. My eagerness drove me towards self-learning AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and PHP.
