    Front-end technologies used in this single page app are:
    <ul>
        <li data-ng-repeat="x in tech">
            {{x}}
        </li>
    </ul>
    I have made use of AngularJS to create this single page app.
    I have used Bootstrap for providing the menu layout with navigation bar.
    In order to navigate between pages, I have implemented routing
    and linked the pages using #.
    <br>

    AngularJS routing is a very useful feature as it loads the different
    pages without page refresh.
